Technical Overview
Built using the Chrome Extension Manifest V3

Uses a service worker to keep the timer running in the background

Stores user settings and progress using the Chrome Storage API

Injects an overlay via content scripts on blocked sites

Uses the Chrome Notifications API to alert the user when sessions end

Default Blocked Sites
The extension blocks the following sites by default during focus sessions:

youtube.com

twitter.com

instagram.com

reddit.com

facebook.com

tiktok.com

You can edit this list at any time from the Settings page.

How It Works
During a focus session, blocked websites are inaccessible and display an overlay.

During breaks, blocked sites are temporarily accessible.

The extension automatically switches between focus and break sessions.

Timer continues running even when the popup is closed, thanks to background logic.

Suggestions for Effective Use
Set a clear, motivating daily goal

Break your work into specific, manageable tasks

Use the break sessions to rest intentionally

Customize your blocked site list to reflect your real distractions

Review your usage data to track your focus habits over time
